Tables:

summaryData
	The raw summarized data which shows means for all measures expanded for all blocks and identifies each subject and each activity for each record

tidySubData
	This shows the aggregate mean which collapses across all blocks for each subject

tidyActData
	This shows the aggregate mean which collapses across all blocks for each activity. 

Data Manipulation:

1) combined x_test records with the activity column
2) combined x_train records with the activity column
3) combined the above 2 columns with each other so that now both training and test data are in 1 table
4) added column names to the data set using by using the text from the the features list
5) removed all data values that were not means or standard deviations, was then left with just 79 columns instead of 562
	a) first copied out all data which contained "mean" in it's column title
	b) second copied out all data which contained "std" in it's column title
	c) finally i combined these 2 sets of data together
6) renamed column names to be more tidy, and gave the activities column a label "Activity"
	a) This required replacing all invalid characters with new ones for the names of all columns
7) replaced the 1:6 values in the Activity column with values corresponding to those found in the activities labels, e.g. Walking, sitting, etc.
8) added a subjects column to the data and labeled it 'Subjects'
9) Melted the data by subject for all column variables
10) took an agregate mean for each record measure to create a mean for each column
11) Repeated steps 10 and 11 for Activity
12) Finally I removed old variables that were no longer needed. to make for a cleane workspace without redudant untidy outputs

Variables:

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals).
